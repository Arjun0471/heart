        <summary><strong>Ventricular septal defect (VSD)</strong></summary>
        <p>
          A VSD is a hole in the wall that separates the ventricles or the lower chambers of the heart. 
          A VSD may occur in isolation or along with other defects in the heart. What happens to the baby then depends on the vsd AND the associated defects.
          This article deals with an isolated VSD. 
          It is a congenital heart defect that is present at birth. Over time, in some babies, this hole closes by itself. Once a VSD is closed (by itself or with surgery), the baby has a totally normal life like any other child.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary><strong>Symptoms of VSD</strong></summary>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large sized VSD:</strong> The affected baby will not have any issues for the first month of life. Slowly, the mother will notice that her baby tires out while breast feeding: as if catching their breath while running, sweating and pausing between swallowing. The weight of the baby will not rise like it is supposed to. The baby will get frequent cough/cold/chest infections. Mothers complain that a doctor’s visit is needed every week!</li>
            <li><strong>Small sized VSD:</strong> The affected baby is unlikely to have any symptoms from the VSD. However even a small vsd can develop complications hence regular follow up at the pediatric cardiac OPD is essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate sized VSD:</strong> the affected baby has some symptoms of the large vsd but not of that severity.</li>
            <li><strong>Older child with a large uncorrected VSD and pulmonary hypertension:</strong> this is a special group. Such a child/adult who has not been operated upon, will have tiredness with exertion. The nails may be curvy (clubbing) and have a bluish tinge.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><strong>Causes of VSD</strong></summary>
          <p>
            A VSD is a developmental disorder present at birth. What exactly causes it is not very clear. There are certain factors affecting mothers during pregnancy that increase the risk of VSD and other heart defects in babies. Some of the known risk factors are family history of heart defects, mother on certain medications in early pregnancy, diabetes in mother from early pregnancy, IVF pregnancy, anomaly scan showing a defect in any other organ system of the fetus (brain, gut, kidney etc).

          <summary><strong>How blood flows in a heart with a VSD</strong></summary>
          <p>
            To understand VSD better, it is important to know how the normal heart works. See figure 1 below (figure of normal heart). The left heart has 2 chambers and the right heart has 2 chambers. The top 2 chambers (RA and LA) are the collecting chambers while the bottom 2 chambers (RV and LV) are pumping chambers. Pure blood is pumped by the LV to the whole body. The body’s organs uses the oxygen in that blood and makes the blood impure. The impure blood returns to the RA and is pumped by the RV to the lungs. When we breathe, the oxygen in our breath enters the blood and makes it pure again. The pure blood enters LA and is pumped out to the body by the LV. 
            Thus the heart supports 2 circuits. The left circuit pumps pure blood to the body and the right circuit pumps impure blood to the lungs.  
            In a child with a VSD, the wall  (SEPTUM) between the LV and the RV has a hole in it. So blood flows from the LV to the RV and then to the lungs. This means extra blood ends up going to the lungs. The congested lungs get infected relatively easily. Also, the LA and LV become bigger in size and pressure in the lung arteries also rises (pulmonary hypertension).
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><strong>Types of VSDs</strong></summary>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Perimembranous VSD:</strong> It is the most common type. It can close on its own if small or medium sized. Only a pediatric cardiac specialist can tell if it may close and if it is safe to wait for its spontaneous closure.</li>
            <li><strong>Muscular VSD:</strong> This type is also very common. This type of defect has the best chance of closing on its own.</li>
            <li><strong>Inlet Ventricular Septal Defect:</strong> this type is relatively rare. It does not close on its own and requires surgical closure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            VSDs can also be classified based on the size. However, no matter what the size or where it is located, all babies/children with VSDs need to have regular follow up visits in a pediatric cardiac OPD.
          </p>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Complications of VSD</strong></summary>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pulmonary hypertension:</strong> this means that the pressure in the lung arteries is high. This returns to normal once the VSD is closed, provided the vsd is closed at the correct time. If the VSD remains uncorrected for a long time, the pulmonary hypertension may become permanent. This has devastating consequences of quality and quantity of life.</li>
            <li><strong>Bacterial Endocarditis:</strong> This is a rare complication seen in uncorrected vsds, no matter how big or small they may be. It is a potentially life threatening infection of the inside lining of the heart.</li>
            <li><strong>Aortic valve prolapse (see figure 2 below):</strong> When a VSD borders the aortic valve frame, the circular frame of the valve gets stretched and the valve leaflets suspended from it, don’t get enough support. Eventually, the valve leaks (also called aortic regurgitation) and this can become a bigger problem than the VSD itself. Surgery involves closing the vsd. If the valve is too damaged, it needs to be repaired or replaced (rarely).</li>
            <li><strong>DCRV:</strong> this stands for double chamber right ventricle. This complication is seen in tiny or small VSDs. Extra muscle bundles form in the RV and prevent normal flow of blood out of the RV. An affected child becomes tired with playing. Surgery involves closing the VSD and cutting the extra muscle bundles. This complication is completely treatable.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>

          <summary><strong>Diagnosis</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Hearing an abnormal heart murmur while listening to the heart sounds with a stethoscope will raise a suspicion of a VSD. The paediatrician may also suspect a VSD if a baby gets tired with breast feeding, fails to gain weight adequately or get repeated chest infections. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The diagnosis is confirmed by an Echocardiogram- In this test, the doctor uses ultra-sound waves to assess the heart function as well as the blood flow. It helps to determine the size and location of the VSD and also other technical details that help the doctor decide the plan of action ahead.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pulse oximetry</li>
            <li>ECG</li>
            <li>Cardiac catheterization</li>
          </ul>
        </details>

          <summary><strong>VSD repair – When to do</strong></summary>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large VSD:</strong> A large VSD is closed by surgery at age 3 months. This is because at 3 months, the risk/benefit ratio is in favour of the infant getting operated. Even more major heart defects are closed at birth or by 1 month but that decision is taken because it is not in the baby’s interest to wait any longer. On the other hand, waiting for more than 3months of age to close a VSD may hamper a baby’s growth and make him/her susceptible to chest infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Small or moderate sized VSD:</strong> A child with such a VSD is kept under careful follow up by the pediatric cardiologist. The VSD needs to be closed if any complication develops.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><strong>VSD treatment</strong></summary>
          <p>
            The standard treatment for a VSD is to close it surgically. An open heart surgery can be safely performed in most dedicated pediatric cardiac centres, in this day and age. The duration of the surgery is around 3-4 hours. The baby will be in an ICCU for 2-3days after surgery. The average stay in the hospital will be for 6-7days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another way to close certain VSDs, especially muscular ones, is by a non surgical method. This is carried out by the interventional pediatric cardiologist in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. An umbrella device is placed across the vsd to plug it. The device is introduced through the groin vessel. There is no cut/suture in this procedure. The patient gets to go home the next day. Only certain kinds of VSDs can be closed by this method. The pediatric cardiologist can determine whether the VSD is suitable for device closure after a detailed echocardiogram.
          </p>
          <p>
            A child with a successfully closed VSD can perform all routines of any other child including performing well in academics, sports etc. There are no restrictions placed.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><strong>Spontaneous closure and surgery</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Some defects close by itself without any treatment after a while (usually before two years of age). If the VSD is large and remains open, a repair surgery will be necessary to close the hole.
            A VSD repair is either a cardiac catheterization procedure or an open-heart surgery. In cardiac catheterization, the surgeon will repair the hole with a patch by passing it through a large vein in the groin. Large VSDs will need open-heart surgery, to place the patch.
